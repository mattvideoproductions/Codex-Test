# Platformer Skeleton

This repository contains a very small prototype of a platformer-style game using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/). It is meant as a starting point for further development.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Pygame

Install the requirements using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Game

Execute the game script using Python:

```bash
python game.py
```

A window will appear with a simple player block that can move left and right with the arrow keys and jump with the space bar.
